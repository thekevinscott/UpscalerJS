# MAXIM Deblurring

[![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/@upscalerjs/maxim-deblurring/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@upscalerjs/maxim-deblurring)

MAXIM Deblurring is a collection of models for deblurring images.

The models were converted from weights provided by the [original MAXIM paper and repository](https://github.com/google-research/maxim). More information on the conversion process can be [found in this repository](https://github.com/upscalerjs/maxim).

## Samples + Demo

Here are some examples of processed images using these models.

import SampleTable from '@site/src/components/sampleTable/sampleTable';

<SampleTable
  packageName="maxim-deblurring"
  models={[
    'small',
    'medium',
    'large',
  ]}
  scales={[
    1,
    1,
    1,
  ]}
/>

import ModelExample from '@site/src/components/modelExample/modelExample';

<ModelExample model="maxim-deblurring" />


## Installation

```
npm install @upscalerjs/maxim-deblurring
```

## Usage

Import the model:

```
import Upscaler from 'upscaler';
import model from '@upscalerjs/maxim-deblurring';

const upscaler = new Upscaler({
  model,
})
```

## Model Details

This model is unquantized and has a dynamic input size. Image sizes must be a multiple of 64. UpscalerJS will automatically take care of padding and trimming images for you, but if you specify a patch size, ensure that the patch size is a multiple of 64; if not, you will receive a warning and the patch size will be increased to the nearest multiple of 64.

## Additional Models

There are two additional fixed input size models that are derived from a tensorflow port:

- `64`
- `256`

To test these models, clone the UpscalerJS repo and inspect the `models/maxim-experiments` folder. These models run considerably faster but exhibit clearly inferior inference capabilities.


## Dataset
All weights were trained on the [GoPro](https://seungjunnah.github.io/Datasets/gopro) dataset.
