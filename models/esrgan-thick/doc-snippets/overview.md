These models are the best ESRGAN upscaling models, at the cost of slower inference. They are best suited to a Node.js environment with a GPU, although can be used in the browser with significant latency.

The model weights were trained using the [`image-super-resolution` Python repo](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution) and subsequently converted to Tensorflow.js models.
