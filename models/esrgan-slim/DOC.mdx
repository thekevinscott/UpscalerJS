# ESRGAN Slim

[![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/@upscalerjs/esrgan-slim/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@upscalerjs/esrgan-slim)

These models are the fastest available ESRGAN models, and are intended to run in a browser.

The model weights were trained using the [`image-super-resolution` Python repo](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution) and subsequently converted to Tensorflow.js models.

## Samples + Demo

Here are some examples of upscaled images using these models.

import SampleTable from '@site/src/components/sampleTable/sampleTable';

<SampleTable
  packageName="esrgan-slim"
  models={[
    '2x',
    '3x',
    '4x',
  ]}
  scales={[
    2,
    3,
    4,
  ]}
/>

import ModelExample from '@site/src/components/modelExample/modelExample';

<ModelExample model="esrgan-slim" />


## Installation

```
npm install @upscalerjs/esrgan-slim
```

## Usage

Import a model, specified by its scale:

```
import Upscaler from 'upscaler';
import x2 from '@upscalerjs/esrgan-slim/2x';

const upscaler = new Upscaler({
  model: x2,
})
```

## Available Models

ESRGAN Slim ships with four models corresponding to the desired scale of the upscaled image:

- 2x: `@upscalerjs/esrgan-slim/2x`
- 3x: `@upscalerjs/esrgan-slim/3x`
- 4x: `@upscalerjs/esrgan-slim/4x`
- 8x: `@upscalerjs/esrgan-slim/8x` (_note: the 8x model runs only in Node_)

All models are also exported via the root export:

```
import Upscaler from 'upscaler';
import models from '@upscalerjs/esrgan-slim';

const upscaler = new Upscaler({
  model: models.x2,
  // model: models.x3,
  // model: models.x4,
  // model: models.x8,
})
```

## Performance + Speed Measurements

## Architecture
This model is trained via a Python implementation of the ESRGAN architecture.

- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219
- Python Repo: https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution

The Python repo has instructions on training from scratch.

## Training Details

The model is trained on 4 scales.

The model is trained on the [Div2k dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/).

It was trained for 500 epochs, with the following hyperparameters:

- **architecture**: `rdn`
- **C**: `1`
- **D**: `2`
- **G**: `4`
- **G0**: `64`

The batch size was 12, and the batches per epoch was 20. The learning rate was set to `0.0004`. The HR patch size was set to `128` or `129` depending on the scale (ensuring it is divisible by the scale) with the LR patch size being the resultant scale `HR_patch_size / scale`.
