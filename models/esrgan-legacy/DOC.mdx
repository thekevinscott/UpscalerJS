# ESRGAN Legacy

<Badges packageName="esrgan-legacy" />

ESRGAN Legacy is a package of Tensorflow.js models for upscaling images with UpscalerJS.

This package contains the five models available in pre-`1.0.0` versions of UpscalerJS.

The model weights include pretrained weights provided via the [`image-super-resolution` Python repo](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution), along with a number of custom trained models.

## Paper

> The Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) is a seminal work that is capable of generating realistic textures during single image super-resolution. However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN - network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge.

## Samples

Here are some examples of upscaled images using these models.

import SampleTable from '@site/src/components/sampleTable/sampleTable';

<SampleTable
  packageName="esrgan-legacy"
  models={[
    'psnr-small',
    'gans',
    'div2k/2x',
    'div2k/3x',
    'div2k/4x',
  ]}
  scales={[
    2,
    4,
    2,
    3,
    4,
  ]}
/>

## Demo

import ModelExample from '@site/src/components/modelExample/modelExample';

<ModelExample model="esrgan-legacy" />

## Installation

```
npm install @upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy
```

## Usage

### Browser

#### Using a transpiler

If using a transpiler (such as `tsc`, `webpack`, or `vite`) import the model with:

```
import Upscaler from 'upscaler';
import gans from '@upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy/gans';

const upscaler = new Upscaler({
  model: gans,
})
```

#### Using a script tag

If importing Tensorflow.js using script tags, import the model and UpscalerJS with:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy@latest/dist/umd/index.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/upscaler@latest/dist/browser/umd/upscaler.min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  const upscaler = new Upscaler({
    model: ESRGANLegacyGANS,
  })
</script>
```

All models will be made available on the global window object. See [Available Models](#available-models) for information on their names.

### Node

Require the model with:

```
const Upscaler = require('upscaler/node'); // if using @tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu, change this to upscaler/node-gpu
const gans = require('@upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy/gans');

const upscaler = new Upscaler({
  model: gans,
})
```

The model will work for both `node` and `node-gpu` flavors of Tensorflow.js.

## Available Models

ESRGAN Legacy ships with five models:

- `GANS`: `@upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy/gans`
- `psnr-small`: `@upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy/psnr-small`
- `div2k/2x`: `@upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy/div2k/2x`
- `div2k/3x`: `@upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy/div2k/3x`
- `div2k/4x`: `@upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy/div2k/4x`

All models are also exported via the root export:

```
import Upscaler from 'upscaler';
import models from '@upscalerjs/esrgan-legacy';

const upscaler = new Upscaler({
  model: models.GANS,
  // model: models.PSNRSmall,
  // model: models.div2K2x,
  // model: models.div2K3x,
  // model: models.div2K4x,
})
```

If referencing the models via script tags, refer to the models by their global names:

- `GANS`: `ESRGANLegacyGANS`
- `div2k/2x`: `ESRGANLegacyDiv2K2x`,
- `div2k/3x`: `ESRGANLegacyDiv2K3x`,
- `div2k/4x`: `ESRGANLegacyDiv2K4x`,
- `psnr-small`: `ESRGANLegacyPSNRSmall`,

### GANS

The `gans` model uses the [pretrained `gans` weights made available via the original Python repo](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution#pre-trained-networks).

### PSNR Small

The `psnr-small` model uses the [pretrained `psnr-small` weights made available via the original Python repo](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution#pre-trained-networks).

### Div2k Models

There are three Div2K models available in 2x, 3x, and 4x scales.

These models were an initial attempt at training from scratch on the Div2K dataset. They've been surpassed in performance and speed by the other available models, and should be avoided if possible.

<SpeedChart package="esrgan-legacy" databasePath="/assets/speed.sql"></SpeedChart>

## Architecture

This model is trained via a [Python implementation of the ESRGAN architecture](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution).  The Python repo has instructions on training from scratch.
