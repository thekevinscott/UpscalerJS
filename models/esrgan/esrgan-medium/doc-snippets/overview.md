These models strike a balance between latency and image quality. They aim to be in the middle of speed and performance measurements between [`@upscalerjs/esrgan-slim`](esrgan-slim) and [`@upscalerjs/esrgan-thick`](esrgan-thick).

The model weights were trained using the [`image-super-resolution` Python repo](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution) and subsequently converted to Tensorflow.js models.
