[I posted a discussion to Github about our upcoming 1.0 roadmap](https://github.com/thekevinscott/UpscalerJS/discussions/163). I'll repost it here for posterity.

<!--truncate-->

* `0.9` - A clean up release, primarily bumping versions to the latest across the board
* `0.10` - First class Node support
* `0.11` - A reboot of model loading and model configurations

Node support is a feature the community has been asking for. [The relevant Github issue tracking that is here](https://github.com/thekevinscott/UpscalerJS/issues/11).

Along with Node support, revisiting the way models are loaded in UpscalerJS is next on our road to 1.0.
