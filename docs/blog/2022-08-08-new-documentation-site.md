Our new documentation site, [upscalerjs.com](https://upscalerjs.com), has just launched.

<!--truncate-->

It's built on top of Docusaurus. Some of the goals for our revamped documentation include:

* An integrated demo page
* Additional information on available models
* Integrated guides and examples
* A fancy homepage that makes you just wanna get started

Rebooting our docs was part of my goal to get UpscalerJS to a 1.0 release.
