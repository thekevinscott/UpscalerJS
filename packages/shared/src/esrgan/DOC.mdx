## Paper

> The Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) is a seminal work that is capable of generating realistic textures during single image super-resolution. However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN - network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge.

## Samples + Demo

Here are some examples of upscaled images using these models.

import SampleTable from '@site/src/components/sampleTable/sampleTable';

<% snippets/sampleTable %>

import ModelExample from '@site/src/components/modelExample/modelExample';

<ModelExample model="<% key %>" />


## Installation

```
npm install @upscalerjs/<% key %>
```

## Usage

Import a model, specified by its scale:

```
import Upscaler from 'upscaler';
import x2 from '@upscalerjs/<% key %>/2x';

const upscaler = new Upscaler({
  model: x2,
})
```

## Available Models

<% title %> ships with four models corresponding to the desired scale of the upscaled image:

- 2x: `@upscalerjs/<% key %>/2x`
- 3x: `@upscalerjs/<% key %>/3x`
- 4x: `@upscalerjs/<% key %>/4x`
- 8x: `@upscalerjs/<% key %>/8x` <% snippets/8xNote %>

All models are also exported via the root export:

```
import Upscaler from 'upscaler';
import models from '@upscalerjs/<% key %>';

const upscaler = new Upscaler({
  model: models.x2,
  // model: models.x3,
  // model: models.x4,
  // model: models.x8,
})
```

## Architecture
This model is trained via a Python implementation of the ESRGAN architecture.

- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219
- Python Repo: https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution

The Python repo has instructions on training from scratch.

## Training Details

The model is trained on 4 scales.

The model is trained on the [Div2k dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/).

It was trained for 500 epochs, with the following hyperparameters:

<% snippets/trainingDetails %>

The batch size was 12, and the batches per epoch was 20. The learning rate was set to `0.0004`. The HR patch size was set to `128` or `129` depending on the scale (ensuring it is divisible by the scale) with the LR patch size being the resultant scale `HR_patch_size / scale`.
